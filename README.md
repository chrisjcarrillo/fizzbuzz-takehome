# Papa 

## Fullstack Engineer Takehome Assignment

## Update

#You Can Either Use the regular Elixir Backend or switch to the Rails backend

* Simply Clone the [`Fizzbuzz-api`](https://github.com/chrisjcarrillo/fizzbuzz-api)
* Change the `endpointUrl` variable value to `http://localhost:3000/api/fizzbuzz?param=`
* Start the API endpoint with `rails s -p 3000`
* Voila

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

**Your task:**

Add a new backend endpoint with the following signature GET /api/fizzbuzz, it will take two query parameters foo and bar. If foo is passed and true call fooFunction(), else if bar is passed and true call barFunction(). If both are passed and true call fooBarFunction() and render the output in the box below

Add 3 buttons here in the UI. One for foo, one for bar, and one for foobar to the react client. Then hit the appropriate endpoint on click with the correct parameters.
